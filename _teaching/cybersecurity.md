## Lab reports 

- The report must be a single web page containing one or more images.
- The web page must be published on the web. 
- You may want to use the [Docsify-⁠This](https://docsify-this.net/#/) service: this service takes as input the URL of a single Markdown file, possibly referencing the URLs of one or more images, and publishes that Markdown file as a web page. In this case, the Markdown page and images containing your report must be published on the web (for consumption by Docsify⁠–⁠This) as a Github public repository.


You may want to check the following examples:
- [Docsify-this template](https://docsify-this.net/?basePath=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alerenda/alerenda.github.io/master/_reports/template&homepage=home.md#/)
- [Example report](https://docsify-this.net/?basePath=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alerenda/alerenda.github.io/master/_reports/IDOR&homepage=idor.md#/) for IDOR vulnerabilities. Note that one of the two vulnerabilities discussed is not described in full: actual exploitation is left as an exercise.
