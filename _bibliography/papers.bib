  abstract={Regression Trees (RTs) have been widely used in the last decades in various domains, also thanks to their inherent explainability. Fuzzy RTs (FRTs) extend RTs by using fuzzy sets and have proven to be particularly suitable for dealing with noisy and/or uncertain environments. The modelling capability of FRTs depends, among other factors, on the model used in the leaves for determining the output, and on the inference strategy. Nevertheless, the impact of such factors on FRTs accuracy and explainability has not been adequately investigated.In this paper, we extend a recently proposed learning scheme for FRTs by employing both linear models in the leaves and the maximum matching inference strategy. The former extension aims to increase accuracy, and the latter to improve explainability. We carried out an extensive experimental analysis by comparing the four FRT versions corresponding to any possible combination of the two extensions introduced in the paper. The results show that the best trade-off between accuracy and explainability is obtained by employing both of them.},

 abstract={Federated Learning (FL) has been proposed as a privacy preserving paradigm for collaboratively training AI models: in an FL scenario data owners learn a shared model by aggregating locally-computed partial models, with no need to share their raw data with other parties. Although FL is today extensively studied, a few works have discussed federated approaches to generate explainable AI (XAI) models. In this context, we propose an FL approach to learn Takagi-Sugeno-Kang Fuzzy Rule-based Systems (TSK-FRBSs), which can be considered as XAI models in regression problems. In particular, a number of independent data owner nodes participate in the learning process, where each of them generates its own local TSK-FRBS by exploiting an ad-hoc defined procedure. Then, these models are forwarded to a server that is responsible for aggregating them and generating a global TSK-FRBS, which is sent back to the nodes. An appropriate aggregation strategy is proposed to preserve the explainability of the global TSK-FRBS. A thorough experimental analysis highlights that the proposed approach brings benefits, in terms of accuracy, to data owners participating in the federation preserving the privacy of the data. Indeed, the accuracy achieved by the global TSK-FRBS is higher than the ones of the TSK-FRBSs learned by exploiting only local training data.}

ABSTRACT = {This article presents the concept of federated learning (FL) of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) models as an enabling technology in advanced 5G towards 6G systems and discusses its applicability to the automated vehicle networking use case. Although the FL of neural networks has been widely investigated exploiting variants of stochastic gradient descent as the optimization method, it has not yet been adequately studied in the context of inherently explainable models. On the one side, XAI permits improving user experience of the offered communication services by helping end users trust (by design) that in-network AI functionality issues appropriate action recommendations. On the other side, FL ensures security and privacy of both vehicular and user data across the whole system. These desiderata are often ignored in existing AI-based solutions for wireless network planning, design and operation. In this perspective, the article provides a detailed description of relevant 6G use cases, with a focus on vehicle-to-everything (V2X) environments: we describe a framework to evaluate the proposed approach involving online training based on real data from live networks. FL of XAI models is expected to bring benefits as a methodology for achieving seamless availability of decentralized, lightweight and communication efficient intelligence. Impacts of the proposed approach (including standardization perspectives) consist in a better trustworthiness of operations, e.g., via explainability of quality of experience (QoE) predictions, along with security and privacy-preserving management of data from sensors, terminals, users and applications.},

    abstract = {In the last years, there has been an ever-increasing interest in profiling various aspects of city life, especially in the context of smart cities. This interest has become even more relevant recently when we have realised how dramatic events, such as the Covid-19 pandemic, can deeply affect the city life, producing drastic changes. Identifying and analyzing such changes, both at the city level and within single neighborhoods, may be a fundamental tool to better manage the current situation and provide sound strategies for future planning. Furthermore, such fine-grained and up-to-date characterization can represent a valuable asset for other tools and services, e.g. web mapping applications or real estate agency platforms. In this paper, we propose a framework featuring a novel methodology to model and track changes in areas of the city by extracting information from online newspaper articles. The problem of uncovering clusters of news at specific times is tackled by means of the joint use of state-of-the-art language models to represent the articles, and of a density-based streaming clustering algorithm, properly shaped to deal with high-dimensional text embeddings. Further, we propose a method to automatically label the obtained clusters in a semantically meaningful way, and we introduce a set of metrics aimed to track the temporal evolution of clusters. A case study focusing on the city of Rome during the Covid-19 pandemic is illustrated and discussed to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

Due to privacy issues and traffic limitations, in several real applications data cannot be transferred, thus hampering the effectiveness of traditional clustering algorithms, which can operate only on locally stored data. In the last years a new paradigm has been gaining popularity: Federated Learning (FL). FL enables the collaborative training of data mining models and, at the same time, preserves data locally at the data owners’ places, decoupling the ability to perform machine learning from the need to transfer data. In this context, we propose the federated version of the popular fuzzy 𝑐-means clustering algorithm. We first describe this version through pseudo-code and then demonstrate that the clusters obtained by the federated approach coincide with those generated by the classical algorithm executed on the union of all the local datasets. We also present an analysis on how privacy is preserved. Finally, we show some experimental results on the performance of the federated version when only a number of clients are involved in the clustering process.},

  abstract={Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is expected to play a key role in the design phase of next generation cellular networks. As 5G is being implemented and 6G is just in the conceptualization stage, it is increasingly clear that AI will be essential to manage the ever-growing complexity of the network. However, AI models will not only be required to deliver high levels of performance, but also high levels of explainability. In this paper we show how fuzzy models may be well suited to address this challenge. We compare fuzzy and classical decision tree models with a Random Forest (RF) classifier on a Quality of Experience classification dataset. The comparison suggests that, in our setting, fuzzy decision trees are easier to interpret and perform comparably or even better than classical ones in identifying stall events in a video streaming application. The accuracy drop with respect to RF classifier, which is considered to be a black-box ensemble model, is counterbalanced by a significant gain in terms of explainability.}

abstract={The quest for trustworthiness in Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly urgent, especially in the field of next-generation wireless networks. Future Beyond 5G (B5G)/6G networks will connect a huge amount of devices and will offer innovative services empowered with AI and Machine Learning tools. Nevertheless, private user data, which are essential for training such services, are not an asset that can be unrestrictedly shared over the network, mainly because of privacy concerns. To overcome this issue, Federated Learning (FL) has recently been proposed as a paradigm to enable collaborative model training among multiple parties, without any disclosure of private raw data. However, the initiative to natively integrate FL services into mobile networks is still far from being accomplished. In this paper we propose a novel FL-as-a-Service framework that provides the B5G/6G network with flexible mechanisms to allow end users to exploit FL services, and we describe its applicability to a Quality of Experience (QoE) forecasting service based on a vehicular networking use case. Specifically, we show how FL of eXplainable AI (XAI) models can be leveraged for the QoE forecasting task, and induces a benefit in terms of both accuracy, compared to local learning, and trustworthiness, thanks to the adoption of inherently interpretable models. Such considerations are supported by an extensive experimental analysis on a publicly available simulated dataset. Finally, we assessed how the learning process is affected by the system deployment and the performance of the underlying communication and computation infrastructure, through system-level simulations, which show the benefits of deploying the proposed framework in edge-based environments.},

abstract={This paper provides an overview of the most recent advancements and outcomes of the European 6G flagship project Hexa-X, on the topic of in-network Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). We first present a general introduction to the project and its ambitions in terms of use cases (UCs), key performance indicators (KPIs), and key value indicators (KVIs). Then, we identify the key challenges to realize, implement, and enable the native integration of AI and ML in 6G, both as a means for designing flexible, low-complexity, and reconfigurable networks ( learning to communicate ), and as an intrinsic in-network intelligence feature ( communicating to learn or, 6G as an efficient AI/ML platform). We present a high level description of down selected technical enablers and their implications on the Hexa-X identified UCs, KPIs and KVIs. Our solutions cover lower layer aspects, including channel estimation, transceiver design, power amplifier and distributed MIMO related challenges, and higher layer aspects, including AI/ML workload management and orchestration, as well as distributed AI. The latter entails Federated Learning and explainability as means for privacy preserving and trustworthy AI. To bridge the gap between the technical enablers and the 6G targets, some representative numerical results accompany the high level description. Overall, the methodology of the paper starts from the UCs and KPIs/KVIs, to then focus on the proposed technical solutions able to realize them. Finally, a brief discussion of the ongoing regulation activities related to AI is presented, to close our vision towards an AI and ML-driven communication and computation co-design for 6G.},

The Twitter platform in particular hosts the thoughts, opinions and comments of its users, expressed in the form of tweets: as a consequence, tweets are often analyzed with text mining and natural language processing techniques for relevant tasks, ranging from brand reputation and sentiment analysis to stance detection. In most cases the intelligent systems designed to accomplish these tasks are based on a classification model that, once trained, is deployed into the data flow for online monitoring. In this work we show how this approach turns out to be inadequate for the task of stance detection from tweets. In fact, the sequence of tweets that are collected everyday represents a data stream. As it is well known in the literature on data stream mining, classification models may suffer from concept drift, i.e. a change in the data distribution can potentially degrade the performance. We present a broad experimental campaign for the case study of the online monitoring of the stance expressed on Twitter about the vaccination topic in Italy. We compare different learning schemes and propose yet a novel one, aimed at addressing the event-driven concept drift.}}

	abstract = {In recent years, several clustering algorithms have been proposed with the aim of mining knowledge from streams of data generated at a high speed by a variety of hardware platforms and software applications. Among these algorithms, density-based approaches have proved to be particularly attractive, thanks to their capability of handling outliers and capturing clusters with arbitrary shapes. The streaming setting poses additional challenges that need to be addressed as well: data streams are potentially unbounded and affected by concept drift, i.e. a modification over time in the underlying data generation process. In this paper, we propose Temporal Streaming Fuzzy DBSCAN (TSF-DBSCAN), a novel fuzzy clustering algorithm for streaming data. TSF-DBSCAN is an extension of the well-known DBSCAN algorithm, one of the most popular density-based clustering approaches. Fuzziness is introduced in TSF-DBSCAN to model the uncertainty about the distance threshold that defines the neighborhood of an object. As a consequence, TSF-DBSCAN identifies clusters with fuzzy overlapping borders. A fading model, which makes objects less relevant as they become more remote in time, endows TSF-DBSCAN with the capability of adapting to evolving data streams. The integration of the model in a two-stage approach ensures computational and memory efficiency: during the online stage continuously arriving objects are organized in proper data structures that are later exploited in the offline stage to determine a fine-grained partition. An extensive experimental analysis on synthetic and real world datasets shows that TSF-DBSCAN yields competitive performance when compared to other clustering algorithms recently proposed for streaming data.}}

  abstract = {Density-based clustering algorithms represent a convenient approach when the number of clusters is not known in advance and their shapes are arbitrary. Nevertheless, they are highly sensitive to the input parameter setting, especially when clusters' borders are close to each other, or even overlap. In this paper we propose FDBSCAN-APT, a fuzzy extension of the DBSCAN algorithm. FDBSCAN-APT is able to discover clusters with fuzzy overlapping borders and relies on the automatic setting of input parameters thanks to the definition of a novel heuristic based on the statistical modelling of the density distribution of objects. An extensive experimental analysis carried out on synthetic datasets shows that FDBSCAN-APT always finds reasonable parameter configurations and produces good clustering results in a variety of challenging scenarios.}}

abstract = {The exploitation of data streams, nowadays provided nonstop by a myriad of diverse applications, asks for specific analysis methods. In this paper, we propose SF-DBSCAN, a fuzzy version of the DBSCAN algorithm, aimed to perform unsupervised analysis of streaming data. Fuzziness is introduced by fuzzy borders of density-based clusters. We describe and discuss the proposed algorithm, which evolves the clusters at each occurrence of a new object. Three synthetic datasets are used to show the ability of SF-DBSCAN to successfully track changes of data distribution, thus properly addressing concept drift. SF-DBSCAN is compared with a basic, crisp streaming version of DBSCAN with regard to modelling effectiveness.}}

abstract = {The paper presents an intelligent system to automatically infer trends in the public opinion regarding the stance towards the vaccination topic: it enables the detection of significant opinion shifts, which can be possibly explained with the occurrence of specific social context-related events. The Italian setting has been taken as the reference use case. The source of information exploited by the system is represented by the collection of vaccine-related tweets, fetched from Twitter according to specific criteria; subsequently, tweets undergo a textual elaboration and a final classification to detect the expressed stance towards vaccination (i.e. in favor, not in favor, and neutral). In tuning the system, we tested multiple combinations of different text representations and classification approaches: the best accuracy was achieved by the scheme that adopts the bag-of-words, with stemmed n-grams as tokens, for text representation and the support vector machine model for the classification. By presenting the results of a monitoring campaign lasting 10 months, we show that the system may be used to track and monitor the public opinion about vaccination decision making, in a low-cost, real-time, and quick fashion. Finally, we also verified that the proposed scheme for continuous tweet classification does not seem to suffer particularly from concept drift, considering the time span of the monitoring campaign.}

abstract = {Recent works have shown that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), because of their effectiveness in feature extraction and classification tasks, are suitable tools to address the Facial Expression Recognition (FER) problem. Further, it has been pointed out how ensembles of CNNs allow improving classification accuracy. Nevertheless, a detailed experimental analysis on how ensembles of CNNs could be effectively generated in the FER context has not been performed yet, although it would have considerable value for improving the results obtained in the FER task. This paper aims to present an extensive investigation on different aspects of the ensemble generation, focusing on the factors that influence the classification accuracy on the FER context. In particular, we evaluate several strategies for the ensemble generation, different aggregation schemes, and the dependence upon the number of base classifiers in the ensemble. The final objective is to provide some indications for building up effective ensembles of CNNs. Specifically, we observed that exploiting different sources of variability is crucial for the improvement of the overall accuracy. To this aim, pre-processing and pre-training procedures are able to provide a satisfactory variability across the base classifiers, while the use of different seeds does not appear as an effective solution. Bagging ensures a high ensemble gain, but the overall accuracy is limited by poor-performing base classifiers. The impact of increasing the ensemble size specifically depends on the adopted strategy, but also in the best case the performance gain obtained by involving additional base classifiers becomes not significant beyond a certain limit size, thus suggesting to avoid very large ensembles. Finally, the classic averaging voting proves to be an appropriate aggregation scheme, achieving accuracy values comparable to or slightly better than the other experimented operators.}

	abstract = {Automatic facial expression recognition has recently attracted the interest of researchers in the field of computer vision and deep learning. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have proved to be an effective solution for feature extraction and classification of emotions from facial images. Further, ensembles of CNNs are typically adopted to boost classification performance.In this paper, we investigate two straightforward strategies adopted to generate error-independent base classifiers in an ensemble: the first strategy varies the seed of the pseudo-random number generator for determining the random components of the networks; the second one combines the seed variation with different transformations of the input images. The comparison between the strategies is performed under two different scenarios, namely, training from scratch an ad-hoc architecture and fine-tuning a state-of-the-art model. As expected, the second strategy, which adopts a higher level of variability, yields to a more effective ensemble for both the scenarios. Furthermore, training from scratch an ad-hoc architecture allows achieving on average a higher classification accuracy than fine-tuning a very deep pretrained model. Finally, we observe that, in our experimental setup, the increase of the ensemble size does not guarantee an accuracy gain.}

  abstract ={Tracking and profiling changes in the occurrence of notable events in a city, in terms of what happens in the different areas and how possible changes are perceived, is an important issue in the context of smart cities: in fact, it may be helpful in developing applications to help administrations and citizens alike. In this paper, we propose an approach to provide time-sensitive snapshots of events within the different areas of a city, and the city as a whole. To probe inside neighborhoods and communities, we propose to use articles in online newspapers, as they represent an accessible source of information on what notable events actually happen, and on the most relevant topics at a given moment in time. We adopt an approach to group up articles by means of clustering, and to automatically assign labels to clusters by analyzing their content. The outcomes of this procedure, repeated along a certain timespan, are able to describe the temporal evolution of notable events in specific city areas. In this paper we show the effectiveness of the proposed methodology by reporting a case study for the city of Rome, over an investigation span of few years, which includes also the Covid-19 pandemic period.},
